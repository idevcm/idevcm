👋 Hi! I'm a software developer from Canary Islands, Spain. 🇮🇨

I have strong knowledge in Java and Kotlin programming languages, where I have worked with SpringBoot and JetPack Compose, as well as with both SQL and NoSQL databases.

My academic background has been enriched with practical experiences, such as my Erasmus+ internship in Italy, where I delved into the design and development of microservices architectures with .NET. I also explored the integration of AI in web applications in Python with libraries like Langchain and vecotorial databases like chromadb.

Among my achievements are:

+ Getting 8th place in a TechHub for Backend developers, getting an impressive score of 1196 out of 1200 points, despite having no previous experience with SpringBoot or Hibernate. 

+ Developing an application for Android devices that is controlled through an eyetracker, showing my ability to innovate and apply my skills in real-world scenarios.

My language skills extend beyond Spanish, with fluency in English and Catalan, and a working knowledge of French and Italian, which I am currently improving during my Erasmus stay.

Although my repositories are currently out of date due to lack of time, I am committed to update them regularly with more content.
