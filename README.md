Hello! 👋 I am a Level 5 EQF - Post-secondary vocational training in Development of Multiplatform Applications student from Canary Islands, Spain. 🇮🇨

Currently I have finished my first year of studies, in which I have learned in depth Java ☕️, and relational databases 📚, among other technologies, such as JUnit, Git, Linux, etc. 💻

My specialty is backend development, where I feel comfortable in solving problems, even if they resist. In this aspect I have a high frustration tolerance. 😅

Two of my biggest ones have been:

+ Without previous knowledge in SpringBoot, nor Hibernate, getting the 8th place in a TechHub for Backend developers, obtaining a score of 1196 points out of 1200 possible.

+ Develop with a colleague a database management application in a week, also without previous knowledge of the framework used.

I am used to work in a team, so I feel comfortable developing a project with a team of 2 to 8 people. I have worked with agile methodologies, such as SCRUM. 👥✨

I am passionate about technologies, so I have developed a high capacity for self-taught learning. Which has led me to learn technologies outside that have not been taught inside the classroom, such as Docker 🐳, or cloud applications ☁️, such as Azure, among others. 🔍📚

My native language is Spanish 🇪🇸, although I also have a good level of English 🇬🇧, both spoken and written. Other languages in which I can communicate are Catalan, and to a lesser extent French 🇫🇷.

I am excited to be part of the GitHub community, where I am open both to collaborate and to share and improve my projects through constructive criticism. 🤝💪
